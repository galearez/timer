# Interval timer app

Simple timer app built with React to work 100% on the browser.

In this version I used React Class Components, because I started this project as a demo to show that I am capable of use a legacy version of React. This will change in the future since I have intentions of keep working on the project, doing refactors on the code and adding new features.
